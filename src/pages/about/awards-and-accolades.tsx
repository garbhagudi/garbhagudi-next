          What is so unique about GarbhaGudi?

            <span className="font-bold tracking-tighter">
              “Every person who walks in will walk out with a smile”.
            </span>
          </div>
          <div className="mt-5">

            Medicine to treat infertility. Our fraternity is constantly updated

          GarbhaGudi During Pandemic{" "}
        </div>{" "}
        <div>
          <div>
            The sudden outburst of the COVID 19 pandemic turned lives upside
            down. Life was not normal and everyone had to adapt to the new norms
            of leading lives confined to the homes. The concern about healthcare
            created stress, but GarbhaGudi relieved people of all fears
            regarding IVF. Even during challenging times, GarbhaGudi was able to
            successfully provide service at the comfort of home and couples
            taking treatment were relieved of the fear and stress of Covid.
            Online consultations were started to help and provide proper care
            and guidance to our patients. We left no stone unturned in our
            endeavour to ensure all required services were provided
            uninterrupted.{" "}
          </div>
          <div className="mt-5">
            The biggest game-changer that was brought in was the IVF@Home
            concept. Couples could now start and continue with their IVF
            treatment from the comfort of their homes, without being exposed to
            the pandemic. We brought our services into the home of the couple,
            with the staff taking all the required precaution to ensure safety
            of all concerned. This helped many couples conceive during the
            pandemic time and also deliver successfully.{" "}
          </div>
          <div className="mt-5">
            In addition to this, there are certain times when patients had to
            come to the centre for certain diagnostics and testing, but complete
            lockdown with no means to commute made it challenging. GarbhaGudi
            understood the need of the hour and came up with an idea to make it
            easy for such couples and offered a service to pick up and drop
            couples by sanitized cars driven by safe drivers.
          </div>{" "}
          <div className="mt-5">
            GarbhaGudi offers treatment that is usually budget-friendly and
            affordable; however, the pandemic created an economic crisis for
            almost every individual and finances became a concern for most
            couples who want to seek treatment. GarbhaGudi understands that
            money should not stop one from experiencing the joy of parenting.
            With this in mind, we started the zero-cost EMI facility to reduce
            the burden of financial stress.
          </div>
          <div className="mt-5">
            GarbhaGudi is a very socially responsible organization. We
            understand that there are couples who run away from treatment due to
            financial constraints. Paripoorna, an initiative by GarbhaGudi and
            GarbhaGnan Foundation, was initiated, with an idea to do its bit to
            extend help and offered up to 50% discount on its services for
            people who are from below the poverty line.
          </div>{" "}
          <div className="mt-5">
            There are many couples who step into GarbhaGudi from across the
            country and sometimes from other countries too. Traveling during
            treatment was the biggest obstacle for such couples. GarbhaGudi
            immediately worked towards making it easy for such couples and the
            result was GarbhaGriha, an initiative by GarbhaGudi that offers a
            free stay with hygienic surroundings and nutritious food throughout
            the period of treatment.{" "}
          </div>{" "}
          <div className="mt-5">
            GarbhaGudi is proud and happy to step into its 11th year of
            rendering service and spreading joy to thousands of couples and as a
            part of the celebration, free IUIs were offered to 100 couples.
            Knowledge shared is knowledge multiplied. The more you share, the
            more it increases. GarbhaGudi strongly believes in this concept and
            the result was GarbhaGudi Institute of Reproductive Health and
            Research (GGIRHR). GGIRHR came into being and it is the knowledge
            and training wing of GarbhaGudi IVF. Since GarbhaGudi is a pioneer
            in innovative techniques of infertility treatments, GGIRHR aims at
            sharing this knowledge with others to address the challenges in
            infertility.

            {" "}
            This is just a glimpse of GarbhaGudi. There is a lot more that makes
            it unique which is impossible to convey through words. This is the
            story behind the success of GarbhaGudi and the reason that we have
            been awarded the Best IVF &amp; Fertility Hospital in India by the
            National Quality Achievement Awards.{" "}

          <div className="mt-5 mb-10">
            Our efforts shall continue to render selfless service to give the
            greatest joy of having a child and our vision is to stretch our
            services nationwide by starting our centres across the country, of
