          Potential Risks of IVF
        </h2>
        <div className="font-content">
          In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a sophisticated set of treatments
          intended to improve fertility, avoid genetic issues, and aid in child
          conception.
          <br />
          <br />
          IVF success rates are influenced by a number of variables, including
          age and the underlying reason of infertility. IVF can also be costly,
          intrusive, and time-consuming. IVF can lead to a pregnancy with more
          than one foetus if more than one embryo is placed in the uterus
          (multiple pregnancy).

          <ul className="list-outside list-disc space-y-3">
            <li>
              <strong>Multiple births:</strong> If more than one embryo is
              transplanted to the uterus through IVF, the possibility of
              multiple births increases. Compared to pregnancies with a single
              foetus, pregnancies with multiple foetuses have a greater risk of
              early labour and low birth weight.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome: </strong> Resulting
              from using injectible reproductive medicines such as human
              chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) to induce ovulation, during which the
              swell and hurt.
              <br />
              The normal duration of symptoms, which include minor stomach
              discomfort, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, is about a
              week. However, if you get pregnant, your symptoms can last for a
              few weeks. Rarely, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can become
              more severe, which can lead to fast weight gain and shortness of
              breath.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Low birth weight and preterm delivery:</strong> According
              to research, there is a tiny chance that a baby produced via IVF
              would be premature or have a low birth weight.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Problems with the egg retrieval process:</strong> Egg
              collection using an aspirating needle may result in haemorrhage,
              infection, or harm to the intestine, bladder, or blood vessel.
              Sedation and general anaesthesia include risks as well, if
              employed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Miscarriage:</strong> When fresh embryos are used for IVF,
              the incidence of miscarriage is similar to that of women who
              conceive naturally and ranges from 15% to 25%; however, the rate
              rises with maternal age.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ectopic Pregnancy:</strong> An ectopic pregnancy occurs
              when the fertilised egg implants outside the uterus, typically in
              a fallopian tube, and affects around 2% to 5% of women who undergo
              IVF. There is no way to carry the pregnancy on since the
              fertilised egg cannot live outside the uterus.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stress:</strong> IVF may be physically, emotionally, and
              financially taxing. You and your spouse can get through the ups
              and downs of infertility treatment with the support of therapists,
              family, and friends.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Birth Defects:</strong> No matter how the baby is
              conceived, the mother's age is the main risk factor for the
              development of birth abnormalities. It is necessary to do more
              study to establish whether particular birth abnormalities may be
              more likely to occur in offspring created through IVF.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cancer:</strong> Even while some earlier research showed
              there could be a connection between specific drugs used to boost
              egg formation and the emergence of a particular type of ovarian
              tumour, more current investigations have refuted these claims.
              Breast, endometrial, cervical, or ovarian cancer risks do not seem
              to have considerably risen following IVF.
