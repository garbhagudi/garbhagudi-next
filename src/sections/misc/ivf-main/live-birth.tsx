          Factors Affecting the Success Rate of an IVF Cycle
        </h2>
        <div className="font-content">
          In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is the most popular and effective
          fertility therapy or Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) method
          (IVF). These cutting-edge techniques were created in response to
          infertility. IVF refers to a group of complex procedures meant to
          improve fertility, avoid genetic problems, and facilitate pregnancy.
          More than 8 million children have been born through IVF across the
          world, and more than 2.5 million IVF treatment cycles are performed
          yearly, leading to more than 500,000 births. <br /> <br />
          IVF is a multifaceted operation that depends on precision and good
          timing as a fertility treatment. A healthy live birth is the
          treatment's ultimate goal, and all of these factors have a substantial
          impact on that outcome. It is essential to identify and manage
          characteristics that are known to impact result before treatment
          begins because of the considerable emotional, physical, and financial
          costs associated with infertility therapies in general, and IVF in
          particular. The following circumstances determine the likelihood that
          an IVF procedure will be successful.
